# CutieHack22
Cutie hack 2022 project
YAY! For our first ever hackathon, we decided to stick to the sustainability theme. We wanted a project that was user friendly and almost game-like? But more useful. The premise for the project is a program to help you decide to recycle or throw away the item you are holding. Our goal is to reduce trash waste and help the planet by reducing, reusing, and recycling!
